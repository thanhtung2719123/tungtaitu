## 🏦 Question 2: Should the Bank Approve or Deny?

### RECOMMENDATION: **DENY**

### Detailed Analysis

#### Critical Issues:

1. **Low Credit Score (43.5/100)**
   - Below the minimum threshold of 50 for conditional approval
   - Significantly below the 70 threshold for standard approval

2. **Affordability Crisis**
   - Monthly Payment: 8,623,000 VND
   - Monthly Surplus: 3,000,000 VND
   - **Payment Ratio: 287.4%** (!!!!)
   - Recommended maximum: 40%
   - This is **7.2 times** the recommended ratio

3. **High-Risk Factors:**
   - **No life insurance**: No protection for loan in case of death/disability
   - **Probationary employment**: Not confirmed permanent position
   - **80% salary**: Currently earning reduced income
   - **No credit history**: Cannot assess payment behavior
   - **Short job duration**: <1 year at current employer
   - **Very low monthly surplus**: <5 million VND category (scored 0)
   - **Renting**: No owned property as backup collateral

4. **Positive Factors (Not Enough to Offset):**
   - No other debts (100 points in debt ratio)
   - Working at state agency (VCB - prestigious)
   - No criminal record
   - University graduate
   - Clean banking relationship

### Financial Feasibility Analysis

```

**This means A Nguyen CANNOT AFFORD this loan without:**
- Additional income sources
- Reducing other expenses significantly
- Financial support from family
- Confirming permanent employment with full salary

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: **VERY HIGH**

**Probability of Default**: High (>60%)

**Reasons**:
1. Payment obligation exceeds available income
2. No safety buffer for emergencies
3. Employment not yet stable (probationary)
4. No insurance to cover unexpected events
5. First-time borrower with no track record
