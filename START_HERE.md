## 📐 Important Formulas (Already Calculated)

### Total Credit Score
```
Total Score = (Personality × 40%) + (Capacity × 60%)
            = (52.5 × 0.4) + (37.5 × 0.6)
            = 21.0 + 22.5
            = 43.5/100
```

### Monthly Payment
```
PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
    = 350,000,000 × 0.02467
    = 8,623,000 VND/month
```

### Payment Ratio
```
Ratio = (8,623,000 / 3,000,000) × 100%
      = 287.4%
```
