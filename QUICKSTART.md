## 📐 Key Formulas Displayed

### Total Credit Score
```
Total Score = (Personality Score × 40%) + (Capacity Score × 60%)
Total Score = (52.5 × 0.4) + (37.5 × 0.6) = 43.5/100
```

### Monthly Loan Payment
```
PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = 350,000,000 VND (principal)
r = 8.5%/12 = 0.00708333 (monthly rate)
n = 48 months

PMT = 8,623,000 VND/month
```

### Payment Ratio
```
Payment Ratio = (Monthly Payment / Monthly Surplus) × 100%
Payment Ratio = (8,623,000 / 3,000,000) × 100% = 287.4%
```
