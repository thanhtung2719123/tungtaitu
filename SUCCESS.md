## 📐 All Formulas Included

### 1. Total Credit Score
```
Total Score = (Personality Score × 40%) + (Capacity Score × 60%)
            = (52.5 × 0.4) + (37.5 × 0.6)
            = 21.0 + 22.5
            = 43.5/100
```

### 2. Monthly Payment
```
PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = 350,000,000 VND (principal)
r = 8.5%/12 = 0.00708333 (monthly rate)
n = 48 months

Result: PMT = 8,623,000 VND/month
```

### 3. Payment Ratio
```
Ratio = (Monthly Payment / Monthly Surplus) × 100%
      = (8,623,000 / 3,000,000) × 100%
      = 287.4%
```

### 4. Each Criterion Score
```
Weighted Score = Raw Score × Weight

Example (Age):
Raw Score: 25 (for 20-25 age group)
Weight: 10% (0.1)
Weighted: 25 × 0.1 = 2.5
```
