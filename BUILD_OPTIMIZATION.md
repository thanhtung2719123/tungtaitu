# ðŸš€ Build Optimization Guide

## Current Build Status

Your Vercel build is running successfully! The warnings you see are normal:

### âœ… Normal Warnings (Can Ignore):
- `w3c-hr-time@1.0.2` - Deprecated but still works
- `stable@0.1.8` - Deprecated but still works  
- `sourcemap-codec@1.4.8` - Deprecated but still works

- `workbox-*` packages - Deprecated but still works
- `inflight@1.0.6` - Deprecated but still works
- `glob@7.2.3` - Deprecated but still works

These are all dependency warnings from React Scripts and won't affect your app.

## âœ… Fixed Issues:

1. **Removed `builds` from vercel.json** - This was causing the warning about unused build settings
2. **Simplified vercel.json** - Now uses Vercel's automatic detection
3. **Cleaned up package.json** - Removed unnecessary deploy scripts

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Build Process:

1. **Dependencies Installation** âœ… (Currently running)
2. **Build Process** (Next step)
